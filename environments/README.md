   actions
* `default.yml`: Full environment including setup for helper repositories for GPU.
   Should work for Linux and Windows
* `macos.yml`: Full environment including setup helper repositories for CPU for
   Macos.

conda install -c conda-forge conda-lock
conda-lock install --name gnn  default.conda-lock.yml
